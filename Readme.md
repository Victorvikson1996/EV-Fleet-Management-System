# EV Fleet Management System (C#/.NET)

This project implements an EV (Electric Vehicle) fleet management system using C# and .NET Core (version 8). It follows a distributed, event-driven architecture based on the provided diagram, featuring a Service Registry, UDP Multicast Space, Event Bus, and Nodes (vehicles, charging stations) with FSM (Finite State Machine), Drivers, Sensors, and Actuators.

## Architecture Diagram

![EV Fleet Management Architecture](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0c8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=)

_Note: Replace the base64 string with the actual encoded image data or a URL to the architecture diagram you provided._

## Features

- **Service Registry**: Tracks and manages EVs, charging stations, and fleet nodes.
- **UDP Multicast Space**: Simulates real-time broadcasting of events (using WebSocketSharp as an alternative to UDP for reliability).
- **Event Bus**: Publishes and subscribes to events for real-time communication.
- **Nodes**: Includes `VehicleNode`, `ChargingStation`, and `FleetManager` with FSM for state management.
- **Drivers, Sensors, Actuators**: Simulates hardware interactions (GPS, battery, movement, charging).
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for fleet management access.
- **Data Storage**: Uses PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core for persistent storage.

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (version 8 or later)
- PostgreSQL
- Visual Studio for Mac, Rider, or VS Code with C# extension

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or create the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet new webapi -n EVFleetManagement -o ev-fleet-management
   cd ev-fleet-management
   Install dependencies:
   bash
   dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
   dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
   dotnet add package Stateless
   dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
   dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRedis
   dotnet add package WebSocketSharp
   Configure appsettings.json with your PostgreSQL credentials and JWT settings.
   Running the Project
   Ensure PostgreSQL is running:
   bash
   brew install postgresql
   brew services start postgresql
   createdb ev_fleet
   Run the application:
   bash
   dotnet run
   This starts the server on https://localhost:5001. Use the /api/fleet endpoints with a JWT token for authenticated access.
   Usage
   Access fleet status, drive vehicles, or charge vehicles via HTTP requests to /api/fleet endpoints.
   The system broadcasts events via WebSocket and updates the Service Registry.
   Example actions are triggered through the FleetController (e.g., starting a vehicle, sending to charge).
   ```
